Examples
--------

The `/docs/examples <https://github.com/contrailcirrus/pycontrails/tree/main/docs/examples>`__
directory contains a collection of `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`__
demonstrating ``pycontrails``.

Launch ``jupyter lab`` to run these notebooks interactively:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd docs/examples
   $ jupyter lab

Data

ERA5
~~~~

Many of these example notebooks make use of ERA5 met data.
To avoid waiting for repeated CDS requests to load, it's best to request the full
dataset up front (the full ERA5 request downloads and caches ~1GB of
meteorology data).

For compatibility with the ``pycontrails`` cache, you
can initiate this request through the ``pycontrails`` API.
The snippet below coincides with the ERA5 request in ``CoCiP.ipynb``.
We recommend that you either run the ``CoCiP.ipynb`` notebook first, or run the
snippet below before interacting with other notebooks.

.. code:: python

   from pycontrails.datalib.ecmwf import ERA5

   time = ("2022-03-01 00:00:00", "2022-03-01 23:00:00")
   pressure_levels = [350, 300, 250, 225, 200, 175, 150]
   met_variables = ["t", "q", "u", "v", "w", "ciwc", "z", "cc"]
   rad_variables = ["tsr", "ttr"]

   ERA5(time=time, variables=met_variables, pressure_levels=pressure_levels).open_metdataset()
   ERA5(time=time, variables=rad_variables).open_metdataset()

OpenSky
~~~~~~~

Because persistent contrails are a sparse phenomenon, it is a nontrivial
task to construct authentic flights exhibiting characteristics from the
vantage of contrail research.
The data in the ``flight.csv`` file was constructed from the
`OpenSky database <https://opensky-network.org/>`__.
We document the process here to ensure reproducibility.

OpenSky provides access to an `impala shell <https://opensky-network.org/data/impala>`__
to query their database of ADS-B flight data.
The query below identifies flights at low altitude in the hour after
2022-03-01T00 (1646092800).
Such flights are expected to be in an initial climb phase or a terminal descent phase.
The two cases can be distinguished by consider the ``vertrate``.

.. code:: sql

   SELECT icao24, SUM(vertrate)
   FROM state_vectors_data4
   WHERE hour BETWEEN 1646092800 AND 1646092800 + 3600
       AND lon BETWEEN -80 and -30
       AND lat BETWEEN 30 and 40
       AND baroaltitude < 2000
   GROUP BY icao24;

The query below selects one of the flights from the first output,
keeping one waypoint at the start of each minute (the OpenSky database
typically contains waypoint data with 1 second frequency.)

.. code:: sql

   SELECT *
   FROM state_vectors_data4
   WHERE hour BETWEEN 1646092800 AND 1646092800 + 8 * 3600
       AND icao24 = 'acdd1b'
       AND time % 60 = 0
       AND baroaltitude IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY time;

The OpenSky impala shell simply streams text data over SSH.
To convert to a CSV, the output of the impala shell can be piped (or copy-pasted)
into the ``query_output.txt`` text file referenced below. The pandas
code below converts the output of the above query to the ``flight.csv``
file included here.

.. code:: python

   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("query_output.txt", sep="|", skiprows=[0, 2], skipfooter=1, engine="python")
   df = df.loc[:, ~df.columns.str.startswith("Unnamed")]
   df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()

   df = df.rename(columns={"lon": "longitude", "lat": "latitude", "baroaltitude": "altitude"})
   df["time"] = pd.to_datetime(df["time"], unit="s")
   df = df[["longitude", "latitude", "altitude", "time"]]

   # artificially clip at 38000 ft to ensure we stay within met bounds
   df["altitude"] = df["altitude"].clip(upper=11582.4)
   df.to_csv("flight.csv", index=False)
